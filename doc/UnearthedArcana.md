# Unearthed Arcana

I'd like to add support for Unearthed Arcana. UA conflicts with PHB in 
some ways, though. So that means it needs to be a setting. If UA support
is turned on, it works one way. If not, it works the other way.

For the calculator, this means that classes will have different (additional)
weapon choices. I believe cavalier/paladin can basically be considered 
fighters for weapon choices. There would also be the capability to 
pick different classes and armor types.

For the grid, it additionally means different armor options by class.
